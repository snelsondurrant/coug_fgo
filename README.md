## 🤝 Contributing

- **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch using the format `name/feature` (e.g., `nelson/repo-docs`).

- **Make Changes:** Develop and debug your new feature. Add good documentation.

  > All code must pass linting checks before it can be merged. We recommend using `pre-commit` for code style and formatting during development. Set it up on your host machine using `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`.
  >
  > If you need to add dependencies, update the `package.xml`, `Dockerfile`, `cougars.repos`, or `dependencies.repos` in your branch and test building the image locally using `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d --build`. The CI will automatically build and push the new image to Docker Hub upon merge.

- **Sync Frequently:** Regularly rebase your branch against `main` (or merge `main` into your branch) to prevent conflicts.

- **Submit a PR:** Open a pull request, ensure required tests pass, and merge once approved.
